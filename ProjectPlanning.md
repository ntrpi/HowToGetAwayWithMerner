## Selected Technology or Technologies
MERN

## Reasons for choosing this Technology  or Technologies
We believe that this technology stack is in great demand in the web development industry.

## Project description
We will be building a marketplace app similar to Facebook Marketplace, except with and integrated payment option.

## Targeted audience and objective
This app will be available to anyone for browsing, but for interaction the user must be 18 years or older.

## Technical considerations (languages, framework, libraries, database, API)
We will be using MERN as the tech stack, and VS Code as the development environment. As well, we are looking into hosting on Heroku.
